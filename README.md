# ACFWS - Automated Competitor Feature Watcher & Summarizer

A competitive intelligence system that monitors competitor announcements and uses Google Gemini to identify new feature releases. Now with Web interface for easy team collaboration!

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Setup Gemini API Key
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

### 3. Choose Your Interface

#### Option A: Web Interface (Recommended)
```bash
python web_app.py
```
The app will automatically find an available port (starting from 8080) and display the URL.

**How to stop the web service:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the service is running

#### Option B: Command Line
```bash
uv run python mvp_demo.py
```

## What It Does

1. **Simulates scraping** Grab's press releases (hardcoded URLs for MVP)
2. **Caches processed articles** to avoid re-processing
3. **Extracts article text** from web pages
4. **Analyzes with Gemini** to identify new features
5. **Highlights important findings** with special formatting

## Output Format
