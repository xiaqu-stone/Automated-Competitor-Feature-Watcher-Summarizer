# ACFWS - 6-Hour High-Speed MVP Task Tracker

**Goal:** Create a single Python script named `mvp_demo.py` that scrapes the Grab newsroom, uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to analyze new articles, and prints feature release information to the console.

---

### Hour 1: Environment Setup & Basic Scraping (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 1.1: Initial Setup:** Create `mvp_demo.py` and `requirements.txt`.
- [X] **Task 1.2: Initial Scraping Logic:** Write initial Python code in `mvp_demo.py` to fetch and parse the main news page using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- [X] **Task 1.3: Dependency Management:** Create `requirements.txt` and install libraries using `uv`.
- [X] ~~**Task 1.4: Refine Selector & Handle Dynamic Content:** Iteratively refine the CSS selector. Use Selenium to handle JavaScript-loaded content.~~ **(PIVOT)**
- [X] **Task 1.4 (New): Simulate Scraping:** Due to anti-scraping measures on the live site, switched to a hardcoded list of article URLs in `mvp_demo.py` to ensure the MVP is runnable and focuses on core summarization logic.
- [X] **Task 1.5: Verify URL Extraction:** Run the script and print the list of discovered URLs to confirm the logic works.

### Hour 2: Caching & Content Fetching (1:00 PM - 2:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 2.1: Implement Caching:** Add logic to read from and write to the `CACHE_FILE` (`grab_articles.txt`) to keep track of already processed articles.
- [X] **Task 2.2: Fetch New Article Content:** For any new URLs not in the cache, write a function to download the full HTML content of the article page.
- [X] **Task 2.3: Extract Text from HTML:** Write a function that takes the raw HTML of an article and extracts the clean, readable text.

### Hour 3: Gemini API Integration (2:00 PM - 3:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 3.1: Gemini Client:** Write a function or class to encapsulate the Gemini API calls.
- [X] **Task 3.2: API Key Management:** Load the API key securely from a `.env` file.
- [X] **Task 3.3: Core Prompt:** Define the core analysis prompt as a multi-line string constant.
- [X] **Task 3.4: Analyze Function:** Create an `analyze_text(text)` function that sends the article text to Gemini and returns the structured analysis.

### Hour 4: Main Logic & End-to-End Flow (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 4.1: Main Execution Block:** Write the main execution logic under an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
- [X] **Task 4.2: Orchestrate the Flow:**
    1.  Load processed URLs from the cache.
    2.  Get all article URLs (from the simulated source).
    3.  Filter out already processed URLs.
    4.  Loop through each new URL:
        - Fetch the article content.
        - Extract the clean text.
        - Analyze the text with Gemini.
        - Save the URL to the cache.

### Hour 5: Output Formatting & Refinement (4:00 PM - 5:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 5.1: Display Results Function:** Write a `display_results(analysis)` function.
- [X] **Task 5.2: Integrate Display:** Call this function in the main loop to handle the output from Gemini.
- [X] **Task 5.3: Conditional Printing:** If the analysis indicates a feature announcement, print a clearly formatted message to the console (e.g., `‚ú® New Feature Found: [Feature Name] - [Summary]`).

### Hour 6: Testing, Cleanup & Documentation (5:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 6.1: Robustness:** Add `try-except` blocks for key functions (network requests, file I/O).
- [X] **Task 6.2: Code Cleanup:** Add comments and improve readability.
- [X] **Task 6.3: README:** Create a simple `README.md` explaining how to set up and run the script.
- [X] **Task 6.4: Final Test:** Perform a final end-to-end test run.
