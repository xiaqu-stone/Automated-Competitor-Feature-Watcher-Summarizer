# ACFWS - 6-Hour High-Speed MVP Task Tracker

**Goal:** Create a single Python script named `mvp_demo.py` that scrapes the Grab newsroom, uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to analyze new articles, and prints feature release information to the console.

---

### Hour 1: Environment Setup & Basic Scraping (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 1.1: Initial Setup:** Create `mvp_demo.py` and `requirements.txt`.
- [X] **Task 1.2: Initial Scraping Logic:** Write initial Python code in `mvp_demo.py` to fetch and parse the main news page using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- [X] **Task 1.3: Dependency Management:** Create `requirements.txt` and install libraries using `uv`.
- [X] ~~**Task 1.4: Refine Selector & Handle Dynamic Content:** Iteratively refine the CSS selector. Use Selenium to handle JavaScript-loaded content.~~ **(PIVOT)**
- [X] **Task 1.4 (New): Simulate Scraping:** Due to anti-scraping measures on the live site, switched to a hardcoded list of article URLs in `mvp_demo.py` to ensure the MVP is runnable and focuses on core summarization logic.
- [X] **Task 1.5: Verify URL Extraction:** Run the script and print the list of discovered URLs to confirm the logic works.

### Hour 2: Caching & Content Fetching (1:00 PM - 2:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 2.1: Implement Caching:** Add logic to read from and write to the `CACHE_FILE` (`grab_articles.txt`) to keep track of already processed articles.
- [X] **Task 2.2: Fetch New Article Content:** For any new URLs not in the cache, write a function to download the full HTML content of the article page.
- [X] **Task 2.3: Extract Text from HTML:** Write a function that takes the raw HTML of an article and extracts the clean, readable text.

### Hour 3: Gemini API Integration (2:00 PM - 3:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 3.1: Gemini Client:** Write a function or class to encapsulate the Gemini API calls.
- [X] **Task 3.2: API Key Management:** Load the API key securely from a `.env` file.
- [X] **Task 3.3: Core Prompt:** Define the core analysis prompt as a multi-line string constant.
- [X] **Task 3.4: Analyze Function:** Create an `analyze_text(text)` function that sends the article text to Gemini and returns the structured analysis.

### Hour 4: Main Logic & End-to-End Flow (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 4.1: Main Execution Block:** Write the main execution logic under an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
- [X] **Task 4.2: Orchestrate the Flow:**
    1.  Load processed URLs from the cache.
    2.  Get all article URLs (from the simulated source).
    3.  Filter out already processed URLs.
    4.  Loop through each new URL:
        - Fetch the article content.
        - Extract the clean text.
        - Analyze the text with Gemini.
        - Save the URL to the cache.

### Hour 5: Output Formatting & Refinement (4:00 PM - 5:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 5.1: Display Results Function:** Write a `display_results(analysis)` function.
- [X] **Task 5.2: Integrate Display:** Call this function in the main loop to handle the output from Gemini.
- [X] **Task 5.3: Conditional Printing:** If the analysis indicates a feature announcement, print a clearly formatted message to the console (e.g., `✨ New Feature Found: [Feature Name] - [Summary]`).

### Hour 6: Testing, Cleanup & Documentation (5:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
- [X] **Task 6.1: Robustness:** Add `try-except` blocks for key functions (network requests, file I/O).
- [X] **Task 6.2: Code Cleanup:** Add comments and improve readability.
- [X] **Task 6.3: README:** Create a simple `README.md` explaining how to set up and run the script.
- [X] **Task 6.4: Final Test:** Perform a final end-to-end test run.

## 🔧 POST-HACKATHON BUG FIXES

### 🐛 Template Error Fix - Results Page ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue Date:** Current session  
**Problem:** `UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'title'` when clicking "View results"

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Template `results.html` expected structured objects with attributes like `result.title`, `result.summary`, etc.
- Backend was returning raw dictionary with only basic fields: `url`, `analysis`, `timestamp`, `article_preview`
- Gemini API returned unstructured text, but template expected parsed data structure

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Created `parse_analysis_result()` function to parse raw Gemini text into structured data
- ✅ Added regex-based extraction for: title, summary, is_new_feature, category, relevance_score, key_features
- ✅ Updated `run_analysis_task()` to use parsed results instead of raw analysis text
- ✅ Added `re` module import for pattern matching
- ✅ Fixed duplicate `else` clause in analysis flow

**Technical Details:**
- Function extracts structured data from Gemini's natural language response
- Handles edge cases with try-catch blocks and default values
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing template structure
- Supports both feature announcements and regular news articles

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ Web application starts successfully on port 8080+
- ✅ "View results" button works without template errors
- ✅ Analysis processes articles and displays structured results
- ✅ Feature detection working: "GrabFood Dine-in BETA" identified (score: 8/10)
- ✅ Results page renders correctly with feature cards and proper formatting

**Status:** 🎉 **FULLY RESOLVED** - Web application now production-ready for demo presentations

### 🐛 Monitor Page Display Issues ✅ RESOLVED  
**Issue Date:** Current session  
**Problem:** Monitor页面Progress更新显示有问题，Runtime一直显示Running

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Progress calculation issue**: 
   - `processed_articles` was set to loop index `i` instead of completed count
   - Progress percentage calculated before articles were actually processed
   - Frontend received incorrect progress data (showing 0% when 25% should be displayed)

2. **Runtime display issue**:
   - Template showed static "Running..." text instead of dynamic updates
   - JavaScript `updateRuntime()` function was correct but runtime calculation needed timing improvements
   - Status transitions not properly reflected in UI

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Fixed backend progress tracking**:
   - Updated `processed_articles` to show actual completed count (i+1 after processing)
   - Fixed progress calculation timing to show accurate completion percentage
   - Corrected status updates to happen after successful processing

2. **Enhanced JavaScript runtime updates**:
   - Improved `updateRuntime()` function with proper time calculation from start_time to end_time
   - Added status-based color coding (success=green, info=blue, danger=red)
   - Enhanced DOM element selection for reliable real-time updates
   - Auto-refresh page when analysis completes

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ Progress bar shows correct percentage (0% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%)  
- ✅ Article count displays correctly (0/4 → 1/4 → 2/4 → 3/4 → 4/4)
- ✅ Runtime shows real elapsed time in "Xm Ys" format instead of "Running..."
- ✅ Status color coding works (Running=blue, Completed=green, Error=red)
- ✅ Real-time updates every 3 seconds work reliably during analysis

**Test Results:**
- Analysis duration: 19 seconds (from 15:07:30 to 15:07:49)
- Status API correctly reports: `{"status": "completed", "progress": 100, "processed_articles": 4, "total_articles": 4}`
- Monitor page JavaScript successfully parses and displays all real-time data

**Files Modified:** `web_app.py` (progress calculation logic in `run_analysis_task()`)

**Status:** 🎉 **FULLY RESOLVED** - Monitor页面现在提供准确的实时进度反馈

### 🆕 Dynamic Article Fetching Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue Date:** Current session  
**Problem:** Application used hardcoded demo data (4 fixed URLs) instead of dynamic scraping

**Analysis:**
- Original `get_article_urls()` function in `mvp_demo.py` returned only 4 hardcoded URLs for demo stability  
- User requested: "动态获取最新的 10 篇文章，并保留每篇文章的原始发布日期"
- Need to replace static demo data with live web scraping for better real-world functionality

**Implementation Process:**
1. **Page Structure Analysis:**
   - Created `analyze_grab_page.py` to study Grab press page DOM structure
   - Created `extract_grab_articles.py` for targeted content extraction
   - Found articles in `<a class="blogHyperlink">` with `<article class="panel-article">` containers

2. **Data Extraction Development:**
   - Created `test_article_parser.py` for comprehensive testing
   - Successfully parsed: titles, URLs, publish dates, categories, descriptions
   - Implemented date parsing with ISO format conversion (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
   - Added sorting by publish date (newest first) for better relevance

3. **Web App Integration:**
   - Updated `web_app.py` with BeautifulSoup import and requests handling
   - Modified `get_article_urls()` to return tuple: (urls_list, articles_metadata)
   - Added backward compatibility for both old and new function signatures
   - Implemented fallback to demo data if live scraping fails
   - Enhanced global state with `article_metadata` storage

**Technical Features Implemented:**
- ✅ **Live Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup-based parsing of Grab press page
- ✅ **Metadata Extraction:** Title, publish date, category, description for each article
- ✅ **Date Processing:** Convert relative dates to ISO format timestamps
- ✅ **Smart Sorting:** Articles sorted by publish date (newest first)
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility:** Function works with both old and new calling patterns
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback to demo data on network/parsing failures
- ✅ **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive test script with validation and debugging

**Verification Results:**
```bash
$ python test_article_parser.py
