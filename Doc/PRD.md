### 1. Introduction & Vision

**Problem Statement:** StoreHub's product, strategy, and marketing teams need to stay acutely aware of competitor movements, including new feature launches and product updates. Currently, this process is manual, ad-hoc, and time-consuming, leading to potential gaps in our competitive intelligence.

**Product Vision:** To create an automated system that proactively monitors key competitors, intelligently identifies new feature announcements, and delivers concise, actionable summaries to relevant stakeholders, thereby enhancing our strategic decision-making and competitive agility.

### 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** Reduce the manual effort required for competitor monitoring by 90%.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Increase the frequency and quality of competitive insights shared across teams.
*   **Business Objective:** Ensure StoreHub maintains a competitive edge by never missing critical product updates from key rivals.

| **Automated Web Scraper**    | The system must be able to periodically scrape specified web pages (blogs, newsrooms, app stores).                                    | Must-have |
| **Feature Identification**   | Using an LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro), the system must analyze scraped text to determine if it describes a new feature.                      | Must-have |
| **Concise Summarization**    | The LLM must generate a clear, concise summary of the feature and its purpose.                                                     | Must-have |
| **Triage & Classification**  | The LLM should attempt to classify the strategic importance of the feature (e.g., High, Medium, Low).                               | Should-have |
| **Local Data Persistence**   | Scraped announcements and their analysis must be stored in a local database (SQLite) to avoid re-processing.                     | Must-have |
| **Slack Notification**       | A daily/weekly digest of findings should be automatically posted to a designated Slack channel.                                  | Should-have |
| **Configuration File**       | Competitors, URLs, and CSS selectors should be manageable via a simple `competitors.yml` file.                                     | Must-have |
